Title: Network Dynamics in Citation Graphs

Abstract:
In this paper, I mainly focus on citation networks, which are directed social networks where nodes represent academic papers and edges represent citations. These networks provide a representation of a paperâ€™s influence and academic strength within the academic community. Basic network concepts are applied in this report to study the structure of citation networks, develop a model based on cascading concepts, perform a temporal analysis to identify trends, and examine possible effects of citation aging.
